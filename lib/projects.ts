      <p>Have you ever wanted to chat without leaving any digital footprints? The Anonymous Communication System makes it possible. It breaks each message into smaller parts and sends them through different channels, so only the intended recipient can piece everything back together.</p>
      
      <p>Hereâ€™s how it works in everyday terms:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-3">
        <li>You log in and see who else is online, just like a regular chat app.</li>
        <li>When you pick someone to chat with, the app quietly swaps keys and certificates to set up a secure conversation.</li>
        <li>Before sending, your message is chopped into several segments, each one wrapped in encryption and even optionally hidden inside an image.</li>
        <li>Those segments travel independently through different servers, so no one service ever sees the full message.</li>
        <li>On arrival, the pieces are decrypted and stitched back together on your friendâ€™s side, clean, safe, and completely private.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Under the hood, we lean on modern tools:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-3">
        <li><strong>React</strong> for a smooth, responsive chat interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring Boot</strong> powering our secure backend APIs.</li>

    <li><strong>Parallel Gameplay:</strong> Enables parallel moves and updates, reflecting the pace of real-time multiplayer games.</li>
    <li><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Proper mechanisms ensure thread-safe interactions and data integrity throughout the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time Interactions:</strong> Player figures move based on card logic and respond immediately to player input.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The project highlights essential concurrency patterns and techniques in Java, applying them to an engaging and visually interactive game.</p>
